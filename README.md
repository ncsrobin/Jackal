# Jackal
Everyone has his own precious memory, however, we do have some common ones.

The Jackal unit is an elite group of four soldiers that have undergone a harsh training regiment to survive in any environment.
They have been given a mission to drive two armed jeeps into hostile territory in order to rescue and extract POWs.

Now the APP version has been released for our players, which is not only derived all memorable features, brings you back 80's, also provides different game experiences in modern age.
